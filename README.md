Ultima Online Server Engine in C#

This project consisted in recreating a small server engine (like RunUO or Sphere) to communicate with Ultima Online Client.

It was written based solely on [RuOSI Packet Guide](http://ruosi.org/packetguide/index.xml).

It is still not functional as we are rewriting and modernizing the source code, since it was written on an ancient C# version.
